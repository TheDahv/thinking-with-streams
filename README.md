# Thinking with Streams

This contains code, references, and other material in support of a video series
dedicated to sharing what I've learned about one of my favorite subjects in
programming: streams.

## How to use this repository

Each folder will contain the code and overview for each video. You'll be able to
tell which goes with which by looking at the folder name, finding a link to the
video in that folder's README, or the table of contents below.

Within each folder, I'll do my best to keep each commit granular to reflect the
various steps in the videos as I'm explaining a concept.
